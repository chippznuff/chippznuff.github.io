This is a collection of all the Post's I made on cohost about my book reading! I know the site's read-only, but moving them all here means I can start hyperlinking.

28/04/23 - I'm halfway into detransition baby atm and it's extremely good but i am getting the Strongest 'ouuuhhgh my god you Can't let cis people read thiiiis' emotion possible and it's good to remember that that is... it's kind of the point of the whole thing  
still not convinced the tv show will be a good idea though

04/10/23 - book rec: been reading short story anthology The Djinn Falls In Love & Other Stories on the train to work this week and it's great. hard to summarise - covers a lot of ground. mosques on mars, djinns-turned-exorcists with awful exes, djinns doing horror movie shit to drone operators, djinns as metaphors for otherhood or power, djinns as just regular magic guys, wot if you were a little spanish kiddo and ya auntie wuz a djinni, etc, etc. it's from 2017 and there's a story about plague vaccinations which is a bit ðŸ˜¬ to read in 2023 but it's also fantastic so who's to say

10/11/23 - hmhm... reading more because of my commute has been great, but I'm becoming concerned that everything i read is going in one ear and out the other - but a "train" isn't really an environment where i can take notes... maybe i need to get into work early and write then...?
