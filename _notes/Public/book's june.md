book's june (yes i am aware it is August)

#### beyond measure, by james vincent

_nonfiction about the history of measurement_

Wow! Nonfiction!! I didn't take many notes on this one, so this'll be short. The book's pretty good though. It had a slightly strange TV documentary style in the way it handled interviews, descriptions of people and locations. Borderline episodic. But it was super readable and it seems a reasonable choice to illustrate how a concept like 'measuring things' has such an impact on culture and real human lives. Covers a lot of ground, from ancient Egyptian nilometers to 'guys in rural Britain who covertly replace the km on road signs with yards'. Had a good time, but it took me a much longer time to get through it than I do fiction...

#### wound, by oksana vasyakina

_modern russian lit about a lesbian transporting her mother's ashes home and mourning her_

(pained smile) Ah... this one cuts to the bone a little bit. I really appreciated it. It wields its difficult, meandering, nonlinear structure with power, intent. Haunting.

#### death in midsummer, by yukio mishima

_short stories by everyone's favourite insane gay fascist (??? bro what else am i meant to write here. it's mishima) (this note gets into a story about suicide and talks about how mishima offed himself if you struggle with that or like offhand descriptions of gore and violence etc btw)_

Preliminary thoughts is that I'm struggling with this a lot more than I did Confessions of a Mask.  
Subsequent thoughts is... I apparently didn't write anything in my notes other than that, and at time of writing I'm now another book behind this.  
The intro and titular story is great - it poetically gets across the difficult nature of grief very well, and I liked the environmental focus. It's sharp. The following three or so... I didn't really get what they were putting down, honestly. Three Million Yen's couple who have weird hangups about money had a like kind of annoying final page Reveal and generally felt like making up a guy to get mad at; _Thermos Bottle's_ affair drama was disjointed; _Seven Bridges'_ catty geisha wishes missed me a bit, and _The Priest of Shiga Temple_. Well, I liked that one, actually - a virtuous, elderly ascetic buddhist priest falls in love with the great imperial concubine and gets all difficult and stalkery about it. Lots to say about wants and needs and self-imposed boundaries.  
I DID like _Patriotism, Doujouji_, and _Onnagata_, which are, coincidentally, the gayest and most violent stories in this collection. The first one is about a husband-wife seppuku pact, and was surprisingly (to me, at least) grisly about it for a guy who actually did that in real life. Guess I was expecting more of a modern right-wing romanticising of Dying For Your Country - cowardly and movie-perfect - and not... guy repeatedly failing at it and puking on his own insides...? This one's also the most sexually explicit. It's really aggressive.  
_Onnagata_ is like an almost-love triangle about a beautiful kabuki actor, the guy inspired to get into the industry because of him, and a naive newcomer director who thinks this beautiful man hates him when in reality he's in love with him, and I think it ties up in this bow of bitter romance and idealism and control interestingly. Mishima's got a wild perspective on what makes something or someone attractive, so the pages on why this kabuki crossdresser is so alluring were really fun to read.  
_Doujouji_ is actually a script for a play about an auction for a big wardrobe with a dark history. Scripts aren't a medium I'm particularly well-versed in, so I don't have a lot to say about the form here. I thought it was fairly evocative - I had a strong mental image of this one, and I enjoyed the more direct comedy and horror elements.  
While writing this I realised that a lot of these works feature on like... object superstitions? A thermos flask, a pearl, a wardrobe, money, a baby blanket, this idealised woman. In a Thing Mishima is imparting and working through every hope, dream, desire and fear he can conceive of. Overall, I liked it as a collection.

#### didn't nobody give a shit about what happened to carlotta, by james hannaham

_black trans woman gets out of a men's prison after 20 years and goes home to Brooklyn_

Really damn good. Couldn't put it down. Very funny, very painful. Stopped me in my tracks completely a few times. I admit I was a little initially taken aback by the writing style - run-on internal monologue, stream of consciousness, deliberate lack of full stops. It's contrasted against a more regular third person style, but stepping so totally into this character's soul I have to read in a Brooklyn accent is surprising. Carlotta's a treasure, though, so I enjoyed every moment with her. Hannaham said he wrote it like this to answer "certain questions I have about narratives and who is allowed to tell them and why...I wanted, as I always want, to even the playing field between the two voices, to demonstrate that they complement each other, and that neither was 'smarter' or 'more observant' than the other; they were just different".  
Prison after 20 years is a setup that could lend itself to embarrassing timetravel-esque cultural commentary, and it does get a little Why Are All These Modern Freedom Havers Hopelessly Dependent On The Ingot (Phones) occasionally, but the emotional core of it and how it writes character interactions is so so sharp that it's completely allowed. Also, not to review things on the basis of 'representation' (puking emoji) but I appreciated that there was no space for internal doubt about Carlotta's womanhood.  
Also, there's a quote on the back from Paul Beatty. I should really get back to The Sellout at some point. Reminder to me

#### DNF: the adventures of amina al-sirafi, by shannon chakraborty

_12th century indian ocean fantasy swashbuckler starring a middle-aged muslim woman pirate captain back for One Last Job_

Didn't finish this cuz I got sick as hell and it was a library ebook I had to return. I wanted to like this one more than I did, but it just hit a little too quippy at one point early on, and I ended up raising my guard too high waiting for it to dip back below my tolerance level again. just as I was deciding if i wanted to get back into the waiting queue, Cohost's own [@fools-pyrite](https://cohost.org/fools-pyrite) also coincidentally posted about how much they didn't like this book, which convinced me to jump ship (pun... somewhat intended). She did rec Chakraborty's Daevabad trilogy, though, which I might try again at even if I have a YA allergy.
