11/04/24 - follow-on from [[sara library archive post]]


hello i am going to make one really big post about a lot of books i've read so far this year. ill maybe make the formatting easier to read later. im going to pin and keep updating this one instead of new ones. sorry if youre in my gc ive just copypasted my review from there

24.04 lapvona/never have i ever/the bruising of qilwa  
07.05 the saint of bright doors  
18.05 confessions of a mask
24.05 light from uncommon stars

### finished

#### light from uncommon stars, by ryka aoki: 
enjoyable? drama about a runaway trans violin prodigy who meets a renowned violin teacher whos students all die tragically. also, there's aliens running the donut shop nearby. it's also very much about east asian diaspora in america. i had a great time with the first half of it but i think the second half started revealing holes.

copyright evasion undertale brought up as an inspiration for the mc and a sort of driving theme wrt shizuka's soul harvesting contract with hell is one thing - that IS a cute generation gap-bridging moment - but bringing it up again and again as the pinnacle of artistic communication on par with Mozart ended up feeling really. we gave a copy of undertale to the pope.

i felt like all the characters who weren't shizuka and katrina were a little under described... i came out of it not really knowing who lan is and what she looked like... shirleys runaway arc was nothing to me because i didn't really know who she was... maybe I'm just missing something but I've read a lot of books this year and haven't had this trouble for a while

tonally it was weird to me because the structure and general message of it felt really like, YA Transgender Inspiration - You Too Can Come Out Of Your Shell And Communicate Great Emotions With Your Lowbrow Art. its something that i can get behind, but it was also combined with a fairly heavy-handed depiction of transphobia and racism and abuse and sexual coercion, and then it all wrapped up in a only slightly bittersweet happy ending. i think... this is a book that'd speak more to people who need to hear it - i think at 18 or so i would have appreciated the loud approach to bigotry, really tackling it head on rather than alluding to it and pretending it doesn't exist? but as an adult i kind of don't really want to see long comment threads of real ass transphobic abuse in a book that's otherwise about, like, what if you got a new mum who really cared about you and you got to teach her about how meaningful anime music is to you and she learned to understand how hard dysphoria is and the aliens at the donut shop gave you a holodeck that let you do any cosplay you wanted* and it also gave you fat tits. *the mc picked SAO

good comic timing though, and i do love a sappy meaning of art story, so even if at the end of it all this wasn't for me it was still a fun read. I've got another book about racism and transphobia up on the docket soon so I'll see if that one tackles that intersection in a way i prefer lmfao

#### confessions of a mask, by yukio mishima
YOU DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES,  
i thought the back half with sonoko dragged a bit more but i get its role there. ending made me fully cackle. i might buy a physical copy. rip mishima you would have loved being a fudanshi

#### the saint of bright doors, by vajra chandrasekera
i put this on my library holds because i saw amal el-mohtar praise it and i thought it would be funny to see if her taste in novels was as dogwater as her writing/i thought it would be funny if we had the same taste in novels so i could play up some kind of pretend parasocial rivalry because i really enjoy hating that book. it was the latter... i really really liked this one... descriptions of it sound like YA Magical Realism or something - the strange not-names, childhood assassin backstory with A Magic Power, scp-style investigation into an unobservable mystery, etc. it's written for adults, though, and it discusses a lot of elements of cultural alienation wrt immigration and queerness and community action etc without sounding like baby's first politic. it goes ffffucking off the rails at the end in a way that was completely surprising to me but also felt earned, that the groundwork was set up for it, even if it took a sec to adjust. i couldn't put it down. A Book For Sara.

#### lapvona, by ottessa moshfegh
what if there was a disabled teenage medieval peasant who was also shitty and everything went wrong for him forever . written very flatly and bluntly in a way I've seen described as like parable-y, fable-y; everyone in it is unpleasant; everything that happens is unpleasant; a bewildering focus on describing bad smells and oedipal complexes. grotesque (positive). a general, kind of insulting? throughline about selfawareness/living in ignorance - it justifies all of its characters' internal thoughts to allow you to understand their actions and decisions, but stops short of allowing them to realise or act on them, because they're all just trapped peasants or insane nobility. like every single character is notably Stupid on purpose, except for the witch, and this one guy who smokes weed with her and suddenly realises the lord of lapvona caused a drought that killed half of them by hoarding water, so he tries to tell the community and they all immediately hate him for becoming woke. it's better than just 'damn ye olde people are dumb as rocks whereas we are Enlightened' but trying to write about why that's the case comes off insulting too. like there's a consistent metaphor where characters are compared to suckling lambs and I'm just ah... the npcs are sheep you say? can't recommend it to anyone ever unless you enjoy, like, gagging in disgust

#### never have i ever, by isabel yap 
short stories by an ex fanfic author. girlhood and queerness and filipino culture and lightly heavy topics treated well. generally modern day with a magical bent - witches and magical girls and spirits and whatnot, although there was one that was like a trapped sacrifical princess x her lowerclass guardswoman that was more overtly set in a fantasy realm. i wasn't bowled over by it in any way, but it was a Nice Read

#### a certain hunger, by chelsea g summers
hannibal milf cougar memoirs shit. pog. girlboss, etc. actually, she's unpleasant, which is great. i loved when she started talking about meat in the same way like... obnoxious carnivore guys do. girl eat a vegetable and stop ascribing your arrogant post-spirituality to a chicken breast. embodied its central character perfectly - a character so self-assured that everything she says and does is right. i read a review that said "this is more a book about gratuitous sex, fancy food, and trips to europe because its the best (except new york city, of course) than it is about cis-female empowerment, cannibalism, or violence. its repetitive use of simile, speaking down to the reader, and infodumps, left me disengaged, bored, and desperate for the end." and i completely agree except for the parts where all of those are good things. i love to listen to an awful woman tell me about michelin star tomatos instead of about her insane crimes because she's so far up her own ass she thinks she's doing epic writer delayed gratification sympathy shit to me. #slag. im making up a guy to get mad at here a bit but why the hell should a book about some cunt eating dudes be Feminism. why should it even be 'about' cannibalism in a literal and not thematic sense. i think what op wanted was a horror movie or procedural instead of a fictional serial killer's memoir. anyway it has a list of 10000000 cws but a bizarrely large one is antisemitism

#### harrow, by joy williams
on paper, ecological post-apoc speculative fiction of sorts, but in practice is far more interested in its (very good) surrealist, dreamlike prose than it is your traditional scifi things like 'Explanations' or 'Narrative'. i liked it, but i also don't think i appreciated it enough. i want to revisit it. maybe i'll read ms williams's other works

_the people in the castle: selected strange stories, by joan aiken_ - supernatural stories by a 70s english childrens author. as someone who was once an english child i enjoyed these - some admirably strange environments and characters

#### this is how you lose the time war, by amal el-mohtar and max gladstone 
Bad
(review: [[this is how we lose the time war]])

#### carrie, by stephen king
my first king novel somehow, and i haven't seen many movie adaptations of his either, including carrie. its fun and i liked it, and the structure was very cool, but it did make the middle-end of it kind of a pain where i pieced together using some cultural osmosis exactly what was going to happen, turning the build's dial way past tense and straight to annoying

#### one last stop, by casey mcquiston
noo yawk timeloop (adjacent) lesbians... this is capital l-Liberal queer writing, but was overall nice enough that i did have to stop and think about my own irony calibration. am i actually tired of anything like this? or have i been assuming it's all worthless because other people have been mainlining every average gay romcom for the past decade? nothing i consume is set in new york or stars drag queens so why, actually, am i like ugh... this is so cliche...? 90% of this is fine and charming, and the remaining 10% is a horrifically embarrassing ending (in the same way that something including memes makes it embarrassing). despite enjoying it and it making me think more about my own standards, i'm not reading red white and royal blue, because i don't hate myself that much

#### falling in love with hominids, by nalo hopkinson
caribbean speculative fiction short stories... i was tired while getting through this and it was a while back so i forgot a lot, but the prose is great and there's some cool imaginative stuff in here. fascinated by the story about the office gardener with the parasitic orchid - really strong voice in it.

#### vampires in the lemon grove, by karen russell
i forgot this one sorry. don't think it was bad though. the story about the silkworm woman gets a bit orientalist but is still a good Story. what is it about white people writing japanese characters that makes them go full and the josei sanpoed to the conbini to kau an onigiri.

#### the left hand of darkness, by ursula k le guin
bruh. found it a bit difficult to start with but the back half was monstrously good. cried. should probably not have left like 4 months in between the first and second halves of it but i'll definitely reread it someday

#### the devil you know, by k.j parker
fun novella about selling your soul to the devil. i love bureaucracy

### ongoing

### did not finish

#### the bruising of qilwa, by naseem jamnia
 sorry to mx jamnia but i got 60 out of like 110 pages in and gave up. wild cool worldbuilding marred by some obnoxiously bad character work and prose. i got to a paragraph about a character's eyesight and it flipped a switch in me about the general structure of how character details were delivered - it felt like they were writing their characters from a Character Development Exercise instead of writing a story first and foremost. a section about the mc looking down at their clothing unprompted, in a situation that called for their attention, and thinking about two of their family members and having an emotion about it, which they did not then carry into the next scene. this is what happens when you let tumblr users write books!!! they write about their \#ocs instead of writing a damn novel!!! storygraph ass 'this book is relatable to me'. if you can describe your book as slice of life i'm going to throw up on it. maddening

### ongoing opinions archived:

_never have i ever: stories, by isabel yap_ - halfway in but i enjoyed the little gayguy witch office romance story and the Wot If Magical Girls Were Real Wouldnt That Be Fucked Up story. the cop violence story was a bit on the nose but i love babygirl santos so its ok

_lapvona, by otessa moshfegh_ - as of 10/04, my current library loan. book that smells bad to read. very good, very evil

_confessions of a mask, by yukio mishima_ - issuing correction on a previous post of mine, regarding the fascist Mishima. you do not, under any circumstances, "gotta hand it to him"

...ok i was just going to leave it at that but i should probably clarify i mean in the eroticism of individual acts of violence way and not the like military fetishism that ties into his fascism way. this book is insanely funny to read as a fujo and i keep stopping to laugh about it. sure dude tell me about how hot st sebastian is some more. real literature
