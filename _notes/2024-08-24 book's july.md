book's july ^_^

#### manhunt, by gretchen felkner-martin

_transgender splatterpunk action horror_ 

Been meaning to read this for a while. Had fun with it - the rapid pace, the action, the nasty gore - despite the, well, everything, you know. The violent (in the cultural, societal sense) and violent (in the death squads sense) transphobia. Not an easy read by any means. Deeply unpleasant but cathartic. And it is an inherently funny premise, I think. To take these ridiculous terf beliefs and twist them into exaggerated mockery.  
That being said!!! I think Ms Felkner-Martin needs to log off! The recurring bits of Online Discourse that pop up are really grating and pulled me fully out. Look, I get it. She's illustrating how useless this infighting is, these arguments are in the face of ~real problems~. But you HAVE to log off and walk away. Tenderqueers aren't real and they can't hurt you. Snidely, briefly regurgitating annoying public discourse... there's just little on offer in comparison to the anti terf rhetoric... it comes off way more halfassed whinging about Kids These Days than anything else.  
Also, I think there might be too many characters for a pace this fast. By the midpoint there had been so many girls introduced that when everything kicked off and they started dying I was like hmm I genuinely don't know who Margaret is. Sad I guess. Not sure it's intentionally reflecting the mortality rate of trans women but it did prompt me to think about desensitization to it all.  
More generally on the prose; Felkner-Martin's film nerdiness does come through in the way she handles visual descriptions and b-movie dialogue. I don't mind this, but I think a lot of people clash with it.  
But - I still liked it! In general the contrast of like genuinely evil shit and awful characters vs the tender difficult love and lust throughout is really good, and I don't think that's diminished by me thinking the author comes off kind of annoying. I'll absolutely still be reading Cuckoo when that's in.

#### dd's umbrella, by hwang jungeun (tl. e. yaewon)

_twin novellas about gender, grief and resistance tied by the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking_

This was nice... quiet and introspective. The first half is about a nonbinary gig worker named d, and their partner, dd, who dies in an accident. I think the grief here is distant, dissociative. d is isolated, and in dd they find community, and now they return to isolation. The Sewol ferry sinking mentioned above barely occurs in it, but the outro is set amongst protests related to the government/media handling of it. even there, it's distracted, looking at the crowds from afar.  
The second half (named "There is Nothing That Needs To Be Said") is about a writer researching their next novel, and not knowing if they're going to write it. A lot of it is about writing, about inspiration - the 'author' here talks about a lot of books and media that have influenced them. Compared to the first half's distance, it's more overt and more actively introspective, almost diary-like if not for the actual form. And again in contrast to the first half, their political resistance affects them more directly, with discussions about uni lockins, police brutality, and how to clean off tear gas residue.  
I don't know a lot about South Korean politics. I know it's pretty rightwing, and last polling showed a majority were opposed to same-sex marriage. I feel like I hear a lot about Korean incels having a remarkably strong influence on popular media. And I especially don't know anything about the [sinking of the Sewol ferry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_MV_Sewol) . I don't think I'm qualified to get into the weeds about its handling of its politics or queerness, but I'll say that I'm surprised about its handling of its nb protagonists. It wasn't addressed at all in dd's umbrella, and only showed up towards the end of There Is Nothing... , where it talked about Sam Smith coming out and their peers' response to it. Until then you could be forgiven for thinking the neutral pronouns in use were for anonymity.  
There's a heartbreaking bit in There Is Nothing... where they discuss responses to the question 'what are you to each other' regarding the person they live with, and how saying they're a same-sex couple could cause discrimination, followed by explaining how many wills they've had to make to ensure no misinterpretation upon the event of either's death. It also ties into a slight thread about disability and discrimination as they think about their degenerating eyesight.  
A throughline between the halves was a distinct focus on touch. d's grief manifests in things feeling hot to the touch, with this metaphor culminating in a very poetic scene that nonetheless sounds like What If Stove Touching Was #Art out of context; and the author describes typing, paperfeel, braille, all with the delicacy of someone coming to terms with the fact that they will rely on this sense to live in the near future.
