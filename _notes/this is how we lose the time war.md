9/02/24 - friends, fellas; it is with deep regret that i announce i have started reading This is how we lose the time war, and also that i think it might be: complete dogwater. i'm sooooooooo pissed off by it constantly. it is teeing up very cool concepts and missing one hundred percent of its swings. its saving grace is that it's short but i do need to be rid of it asap

29/02/24 - 
finished it two days ago

29/02/24 - okayyyy I'll elaborateeeeeeeee sorry if you liked this booooooooookkkkkkk

i thought the prose was unbelievably tortured; choppy and over-deliberated in a way that felt like teenage poetry with none of the earnestness. like it was designed for social media bios. it felt like it was meant to be spoken over a hollywood trailer. it wasn't quippy, but quotey, blurby. there was no stylistic differentiation between character(s) or narrative voice, which is _damning_ for a book almost entirely about two people exchanging letters.  
it veered into modern pop culture references occasionally, which can be funny and humanizing in good time travel stories (i love doctor who toxic amv), but felt restrictive and thoughtless in the context of its terrible writing and extremely undeveloped setting and character.  
i found the first half boring. there were no stakes! if you're going to write two timeslipping superhumans chasing each other across parallel universes, i want some push and pull! i want these characters to be interested in each other! i want to know what they see in each other! instead they wrote to each other like they were in love with the idea of having someone to love, but i don't even believe for a second the book was operating on that level.

i kept catching myself thinking things like... you know, alienating writing would be really interesting for a book about a romance between two people in a civilisation and culture extremely far removed from our own. alienating writing would be really cool in relation to the act of writing itself - it IS really cool to trade love letters via metaphor-laden steganography out of hatelove for your enemy! this is what i mean about it teeing up shots and missing!!!!! - but it had no real interest in that beyond pure aesthetic appeal. nothing about the time war was established - nothing about the two factions were established - nothing about any character's motivations were established. even their love wasn't established.

like, look. i'm happy to work with little. i like a short story, i like an abstract story. i like wanky fucking purple prose and i especially like it in relation to love and art. but time war felt like it had no _interest_ in anything beyond, like, a vague description of its tropes. the sound of its own voice. it had no interest in creating its world or characters, but it also had no interest in its form or themes. it needed to go harder, or it needed to go shorter - go full epistolary, even, and use the point of view interestingly. but in this weird middle ground of disinterest it's just nothing. trigun is better than this repurposed tumblr rp.
